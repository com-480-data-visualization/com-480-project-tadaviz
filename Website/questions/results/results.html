    <h3>Extraversion</h3>
    <p>A strong score is link to Extraversion, and a low one to introversion.
      Extroverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as full
      of energy. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals. They possess
      high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves. Extroverted people may
      appear more dominant in social settings, as opposed to introverted people in this setting.
      Introverts have lower social engagement and energy levels than extroverts.
      They tend to seem quiet, low-key, deliberate, and less involved in the social world.
      Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression;
      instead they are more independent of their social world than extroverts. Introverts
      need less stimulation, and more time alone than extroverts. This does not mean that
      they are unfriendly or antisocial; rather, they are reserved in social situations.</p> <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Descriptions_of_the_particular_personality_traits"> Wikipedia</a></cite>

    <h3>Emotional stability</h3>
    <p>Those who score low in emotional stability are emotionally reactive and vulnerable
      to stress, also tending to be flippant in the way they express emotion.
      They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and
      minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional reactions
      tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which means they are often
      in a bad mood. For instance, low emotional stability is connected to a pessimistic approach
      toward work, confidence that work impedes personal relationships, and apparent
      anxiety linked with work.</p> <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Descriptions_of_the_particular_personality_traits"> Wikipedia</a></cite>

    <h3>Agreeableness</h3>
    <p>The agreeableness trait reflects individual differences in general concern
      for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.
      They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy,
      helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others. Agreeable
       people also have an optimistic view of human nature.
       Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with others.
       They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and are less likely
       to extend themselves for other people. Sometimes their skepticism about
       others' motives causes them to be suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
       Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people,
       which can be seen as argumentative or untrustworthy..</p> <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Descriptions_of_the_particular_personality_traits"> Wikipedia</a></cite>

    <h3>Conscientiousness</h3>
    <p>Conscientiousness is a tendency to display self-discipline, act dutifully,
       and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations. It is
        related to the way in which people control, regulate, and direct their impulses.
         High conscientiousness is often perceived as being stubborn and focused. Low conscientiousness
         is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of
         reliability.[35] High scores on conscientiousness indicate a preference for planned rather than
         spontaneous behavior.</p> <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Descriptions_of_the_particular_personality_traits"> Wikipedia</a></cite>

      imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. People who are open to experience
